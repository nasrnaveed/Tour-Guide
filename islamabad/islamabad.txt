<h1>History and Importance : </h1>

<p ><i>Islamabad is the capital city of Pakistan, and is administered by the Pakistani federal government as part of the <br>
Islamabad Capital Territory. It is the ninth-largest city in Pakistan, while the larger Islamabadâ€“Rawalpindi metropolitan <br>
area is the country's third-largest with a population of about 4.1 million people. Built as a planned city in the 1960s to <br>
replace Karachi as Pakistan's capital, Islamabad is noted for its high standards of living, safety, and abundant greenery.<br>
The master plan for the city was designed by Greek architect Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis and divides the city into eight <br>
zones, including administrative, diplomatic enclave, residential areas, educational and industrial sectors, commercial areas, <br>
as well as rural and green areas which are administered by the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation with support from the <br>
Capital Development Authority. Islamabad is known for the presence of several parks and forests, including the Margalla Hills <br>
National Park and the Shakarparian. It is home to several landmarks, with the most notable one being the Faisal Mosque, the <br>
largest mosque in South Asia and the fifth-largest in the world. Other landmarks include the Pakistan National Monument and <br>
the Democracy Square.
