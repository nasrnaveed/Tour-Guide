<h1>History and Importance : </h1>
<p ><i>New York City (NYC), often simply called New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With <br>
an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New <br>
York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the <br>
southern tip of the State of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, <br>
the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban area. With almost 20 million people in its <br>
metropolitan statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined statistical area, it <br>
is one of the world's most populous megacities. New York City has been described as the <br>
cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce, <br>
entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports, <br>
and is the most photographed city in the world. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, <br>
New York is an important center for international diplomacy, and has sometimes been called the <br>
capital of the world.<br>
Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is composed of five boroughs, <br>
each of which is a county of the State of New York. The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, <br>
the Bronx, and Staten Island—were created when local governments were consolidated into a single city<br>
in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to <br>
the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically <br>
diverse city in the world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United <br>
States, the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016. As of 2019, the New <br>
York metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $2.0 trillion. <br>
If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have the eighth-largest economy in <br>
the world. New York is home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.
