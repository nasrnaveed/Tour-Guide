<h1>History and Importance : </h1>
<p ><i>Edmonton is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan <br>
River and is the centre of the Edmonton Metropolitan Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's <br>
central region. The city anchors the north end of what Statistics Canada defines as the <br>
"Calgaryâ€“Edmonton Corridor".<br>
The metro area of Edmonton had a population of 1,491,000 at the beginning of 2021, making it <br>
Alberta's second-largest city (after Calgary) and Canada's fifth-largest municipality. Edmonton's <br>
2019 municipal census subsequently recorded a population of 972,223.[10] Also in 2016, Edmonton <br>
had a metropolitan population of 1,321,426, making it the sixth-largest census metropolitan <br>
area (CMA) in Canada. Edmonton is North America's northernmost metropolitan area with a population <br>
over one million. A resident of Edmonton is known as an Edmontonian.<br>
Edmonton is a cultural, governmental and educational centre. It hosts a year-round slate of festivals, <br>
reflected in the nickname "Canada's Festival City". It is home to North America's largest mall, West <br>
Edmonton Mall (the world's largest mall from 1981 until 2004), and Fort Edmonton Park, Canada's <br>
largest living history museum.
